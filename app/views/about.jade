          p We love breakfast. And not just the food, but all that encompasses “breakfast time” — fresh coffee, the newspaper, a wholesome breakfast, the moments before the day takes hold. Our inspiration for Seven Sundays muesli came to us during a trip to New Zealand where we were immersed into one of the most admirable cultures in the world. “Kiwis”, as native New Zealanders are often called, live active, sustainable lifestyles built upon enjoying simple pleasures and making the most out of their treasured and limited natural resources. One of our favorite parts of the trip was starting each day with a bowl of fresh, homemade toasted muesli, a popular New Zealand breakfast. We so much enjoyed this simple but gourmet breakfast staple that we were determined to give breakfast in the U.S. a facelift. So, we started making our own hearty, gourmet muesli using our favorite combinations from New Zealand and adding our own special twists. We hope you enjoy! -Hannah & Brady

          p The name “Seven Sundays”?  Well, for us, breakfast is more than a meal, it’s a time.  A time to enjoy fresh coffee, the newspaper and the moments before the day takes hold – like a Sunday morning.  We want our mueslis to be a reminder to enjoy breakfast time on Sunday and every day of the week.

        figure.poxa12b12b_18c12c_18d11d_18poxe11
          p Seven Sundays’ mission is to promote healthy and enjoyable morning routines so that more people start their day feeling relaxed, energized and satisfied. We create gourmet breakfast foods that taste homemade and use only all natural, super healthy ingredients. We measure success beyond our products, so we continuously work to better our employees, the environment and the communities around us.
          p We have always been particularly picky when it comes to the food we make in our home kitchen. Along with using real, fresh and healthy ingredients whenever possible, we also think a little extra effort—like using unique flavors and homemade recipes—goes a long way to making a meal “special”. Food should be enjoyed not just eaten. We carry our “kitchen standards” to all our mueslis. For us, it’s all just common sense.

          h4 WE ♥ MOTHER NATURE
          p At Seven Sundays, we believe sustainability means more than just being “green”. We see sustainability as essential to the resiliency of our business, and more importantly, the world around us. This means that in all our decisions — from choosing a grain supplier to selecting our packaging — we ask ourselves whether our actions will have a positive impact on the environment and our community. It’s pretty simple, but then again, doing the right thing usually is!
          p Here are a few examples, but we know this is just the start of our journey…
          
          h4 PURE FOOD = NO CHEMICALS
          p Eating foods without pesticides or preservatives is not only good for your health, it’s good for the environment. Fertilizers are created using fossil fuels, which are limited resources, and pesticides can run-off into our rivers and streams. We also ensure there are no ingredients in our muesli that you can’t pronounce!
          
          h4 LESS IS MORE
          p Everyone wins when packaging waste is minimized. Our package consists of unbleached, uncoated, natural paperboard that is 100% recyclable. Our goal is to move toward 100% recycled content, or even better, a reusable container option that can be refilled. There is nothing better than a glass jar full of fresh muesli on your kitchen table!
          
          h4 KEEPING IT CLOSE TO HOME
          p We source products that make sense. Most of the time, that means buying ingredients that are local and have less distance to travel to get to our facility. It also means finding ingredients that are minimally processed to reduce the amount of energy required to get it from “farm to table”. Starting with our largest volume ingredients (e.g. grains, seeds, honey), we have successfully sourced our ingredients from the Midwest or our neighbors to the north (hint: Canada).
          
          h4 HEALTH EDUCATION
          p As a food company, one of the biggest impacts we can have is raising the bar of what is considered “healthy” through education. Understanding a nutritional label is step one, but we think it’s even more important to really understand what you are eating, where it comes from, and how it is processed.
          
          h4 1% FOR THE PLANET (FTP)
          p Right here in Minnesota, we have an amazing organization who make it their mission to ensure fair and sustainable food, farm and trade systems. You know…so the rest of us can eat…FOREVER. As a member of 1% for the Planet, we proudly donated 1% of our 2013 sales to Institute for Agricultural and Trade Policy (IATP).
